(in progress) This project is based on the common strawman argument from creationists which upholds the view that evolution is akin to taking apart a clock (a complex and intricate object), throwing it in a box, and shaking the box for millions of years expecting a clock to emerge at the end. this is clearly a false analogy when you consider that clocks are not living organisms subject to the pressures of natural selection where the parts themselves have an affinity for each other. this program here seeks to demonstrate how a clock could form if it were subject to the same pressures which are put on organisms in the natural world. In terms of generating structures this is probably most analagous to the spotanious generation of complex protien structures which have natural affinites for eachother.
