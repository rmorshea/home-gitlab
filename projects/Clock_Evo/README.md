(in progress) This project is based on the common strawman argument
concerning evolution which upholds the view that the theory
is akin to taking apart a clock (a complex and intricate object), throwing
it in a box, and shaking the box for millions of years expecting a perfectly
formed clock to emerge at the end. This is clearly a false analogy when one
considers that clocks are not living organisms which are subject to the
pressures of natural selection, nor do the individual parts of a clock have
natural affinities for each other. This program here seeks to demonstrate
how a clock could form over a period of time if it were subject to the same
pressures which are put on organisms in the natural world. In terms of the
real world, this model is probably most analagous to the spotanious
generation of complex protien structures where all the protiens have natural
affinites for eachother.
